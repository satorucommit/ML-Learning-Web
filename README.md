## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (for loading external libraries)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ml-learning-web-app
open index.html
```

Alternatively, you can run a local server:

```bash
