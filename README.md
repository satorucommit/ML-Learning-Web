## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (for loading external libraries)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ml-learning-web-app

# Open in browser
open index.html  # macOS
# OR
start index.html  # Windows
# OR
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
```

Alternatively, you can run a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html          # Main HTML file with all content
├── styles.css          # Custom CSS styles and animations
├── script.js           # JavaScript functionality and interactivity
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── LICENSE             # MIT License file

└── screenshot.txt      # Description of screenshot content
```

The application is built as a single-page application with all functionality contained in three main files for easy deployment and modification.

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

The application is compatible with all modern browsers that support ES6 JavaScript features:

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

Internet Explorer is not supported due to its lack of modern JavaScript features.

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

- All external libraries are loaded via CDN for faster loading times
- The application is lightweight with minimal dependencies
- Charts are rendered efficiently using Chart.js
- Code highlighting is only applied when modals are opened
- Animations are optimized using CSS transitions
- Dark mode preference is saved in localStorage for persistence

## 🔧 Customization

To customize the application:

1. Modify content in [index.html](index.html)
2. Adjust styling in [styles.css](styles.css)
3. Update JavaScript functionality in [script.js](script.js)
4. Add new resources in the Resources section
5. Modify quiz questions in the quizQuestions array
6. Update code examples in the codeExamples object

Key customization points:
- Update color scheme in CSS variables
- Add new learning modules by following the existing structure
